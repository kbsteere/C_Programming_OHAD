This is meant to review C programming in general and practice simple tasks. 

#### Chapter 1: Getting Started with C
The beginning of this chapter covers the basics of how a program in C is compiled 
and linked. It talks about IDEs and provides a list of ones that the reader can use and 
has the reader generate the standard "Hello, World!" program. I think this chapter could have touched on some important items. Like using gcc via the terminal to compile code. Maybe i'm partial being engineer and liking to understand how things work, but I believe the reader could have benefitied from how an IDE compiles and links code since most basically use a form of gcc/g++ no matter what OS environment is being used.
